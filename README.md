## Description

Under your own user profile, you can add the book after filling in the book title, author and selecting the right category. Optionally, you may also add year and a brief description of the book. For instance, the description may include your own review of the book. Then, you decide whether you have already read this book, or you just want to read it in the future.

You have the option to view the *read books* separately from *books to read*, but you may also view them all at once.

Bookworm allows you to change info of existing book, put the book to read to the *read books* group. You may also delete it if you no longer want to keep this book in your itinerary. When displaying the books, you may filter them either using the searchbar and/or the book category.
